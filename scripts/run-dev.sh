# Kill-before-start preamble for dev servers that bind a fixed port.
#
# Usage: scripts/run-dev.sh <PORT> -- <command> [args...]
#
# Finds any process currently listening on <PORT>, SIGTERMs it, waits briefly,
# then SIGKILLs survivors. Then execs the provided command, which should start
# a new server on the same port.
#
# This exists because terminals close uncleanly (especially under AI agents),
# which can leave dev-server children (e.g. `next dev`) reparented to launchd
# and still bound to the port. Rather than require manual cleanup, every dev
# task nukes whatever stale process owns its port before starting fresh.
#
# Worktree port offsets (see scripts/wt.ts) guarantee that no two live
# worktrees share a port, so this never clobbers another worktree's work.
