#!/bin/bash
#
# Launches Google Chrome Dev with the DevTools remote-debugging protocol
# enabled so agents / scripts can attach.
#
# Per-worktree isolation (opt-in via env):
#   - WORKTREE_PORT_OFFSET shifts the debug port by that many units (default 0).
#   - WORKTREE_SLUG names the user-data-dir so each worktree has its own
#     isolated Chrome profile and the worktrees don't fight over a shared dir.
#
# Main clone (neither var set) keeps the historical port 9222 and the
# "/tmp/chrome-devtools-codex" user-data-dir so nothing changes for users not
# running out of a worktree.
#
# After launching, this script waits for the debug port to accept connections
# before returning, so callers can attach immediately without racing the
# first-launch macOS permissions dialog.

# Neither bash nor `bun run` auto-load `.env.worktree`, so when this script is
# launched outside a moon task (e.g. directly from the worktree root) the
# `WORKTREE_*` vars would otherwise be missing and chrome would open on
# the main clone's debug port. Walk up from $PWD until we find `.env.worktree`
# or hit a `.git` entry (worktree root marker) and source the file so its keys
# are exported for the remainder of this script. Pre-existing env vars win.
